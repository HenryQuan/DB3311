# DB3311
Assignments, labs and past exams for COMP3311.

## Afterthought
I got credit (70%) for this course. It is actually way better than what I expected. My assignments (20.9/30) and quizzes (9/10) were quite good. I got around 40/60 in my final which is so good. I did a week study on it so maybe that's why. This course is really useful in real life. It might be easier than other third year courses but it does not mean that it is useless. I recommend this course.
